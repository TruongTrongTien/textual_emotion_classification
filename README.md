# MINI PROJECT: TEXTUAL EMOTION RECOGNITION IN VIETNAMESE

## Introduction
Welcome to our Textual Emotion Recognition in Vietnamese project. Harnessing the power of advanced machine learning techniques, our model is tailored to accurately classify emotions conveyed in sentences. From enjoyment to sadness, anger to surprise, our solution enables precise emotion detection in Vietnamese text, opening avenues for improved sentiment analysis and deeper understanding of human communication.

## Dataset
The [UIT-VSMEC dataset](https://metatext.io/datasets/vietnamese-social-media-emotion-corpus-uit-vsmec) is a collection of text data created by the University of Information Technology for sentiment analysis and emotion recognition tasks in the Vietnamese language.
It includes 6927 human-annotated text samples with 7 emotion labels from social media and online forums, providing a valuable resource for training and evaluating NLP models in Vietnamese.
